    title: "Multi-armed bandits for fun and profit"
    subtitle: "<short>In this talk we will cover a specific kind of Markov decision process called the Multi-armed bandit which is used to model many common use cases in reinforcement learning such as A/B testing, clinical trials, ad-serving, resource allocation, recommendations etc. Bandit algorithms come in stochastic and adversarial flavors with different variations, all seeking to maximize some form of expected payout while keeping the total regret low.<br/>We will discuss some common strategies to solve different kinds of bandit problems, their optimality with respect to the exploration-exploitation tradeoff as well as the empirical performance on real datasets.

    title: "Deep data on Television"
    subtitle: "<short>The mobile has made tremendous progress - but it is still referred as `second screen` to the Television. Television (specifically Live TV) will continue to be the most efficient way to get high quality content to millions of homes. Even though all the devices around us have gotten smarter - people still watch TV by memorizing channel numbers and move between painful guides. At the root of this problem is the lack of enough `smart` data about what's happening on TV. Do you know? <br/>
    <br/>
    * What channels are playing English Action Movies that are not in an Ad Break?<br/>
    * Do you know which Ad is playing on (say) Star Plus?<br/>
    * Do you know which celebrities are on screen - right now - across 400 channels?<br/>
    * Do you know which shows are talking about Trump, right now?<br/>
    <br/>
    Deeper data about Live TV enables much better experiences for the viewer, but the entire industry. The industry does not know what exactly people are watching on TV.<br/>
    At Sensara, we've built a Deep TV Engine, that mines real time information about the ads, songs, and promos playing out on TV; and even knows the celebrities on screen. The talk will discuss how machine learning is used to build deep information on TV at scale.<br/></short>"
